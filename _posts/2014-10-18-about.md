  Last year at The Greater Chicago Food Depository, they distributed enough food to be equivalent to 154,000 meals a day. For this reason I chose to do my volunteer work at The Greater Chicago Food Depository. Their number one goal is to end hunger and not just by handing out bags of chips and cans of soda. They distribute fresh produce and other fresh items as much as possible to ensure that these food insecure people have some nutritious intake.

The [Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/) (HBC) provides bioinformatics support for Harvard Medical School researchers. This has been made possible through funding from the [HMS Tools and Technology Program](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments/tools-and-technology) (TnT).

Our Core staff are available to help with the **management, integration, and contextual analysis of high-throughput biological data**, focusing on **next-generation sequencing support**. We [provide consulting, training, tools, databases and best practices](#support), while fostering collaboration and a community of bioinformatic activities. We also build unified infrastructure to support a diverse set of experimental systems and high-throughput biological data.

With the help of this funding, HBC can now **offer subsidized [consults](#fees)** to researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the [Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments). Please [contact us](#contact) with any questions and support requests you might have.
